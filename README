A simple shell script to remove file paths from each line in a file.

Useful if you are looking forward to just obtaining the list of filenames after executing a locate or find command for a specific file type in the terminal.

There are several ways to extend this, for example you can add a sort line to sort the output, format the output, etcetera.
